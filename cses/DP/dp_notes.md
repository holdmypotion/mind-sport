# DP

- if forming transitions are getting complex with the 1d state try using 2d state
- don't spend too much time starting from a compressed state and forming transition. Just increase the dimensions of the state and look from a different perspective.
- most difficult dp questions have 2d+ state because the number of conditions for the solution are quite a lot.
- transitions become somewhat easy as the dimensions of the state increase.
